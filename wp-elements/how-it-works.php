<p>PicoSearch is a lightweight search plugin that works out of the box. You do not need to configure anything or manually update any indexes for it to work.</p>

<p>The index is automagically updated in the background and your posts will appear in search results as soon as they are added to the index.</p>

<p>If you have any problems please file an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/picocodes/picosearch">GitHub page</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible. </p>
